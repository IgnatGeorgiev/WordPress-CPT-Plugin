This plugin allows the user to create an event post type. When activated it directly creates the post type and allows the user to post some events. There are some custom fields, such as: Location, Date and an event URL. The location metafield gets displayed on the archive and single page by a map, provided by the Google Maps API. Also for each event there is a button, allowing the end users to add the event to their calender. This feature is provided by https://www.addevent.com .
